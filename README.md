# Welcome to the STA Platform Team's Learning Managment System CDK Python project!

We have deployed Moodle LMS using the AWS CDK. 

CDK defined infrastructure in ./Moodle
The `cdk.json` file tells the CDK Toolkit how to execute your app.
Development instructions in ./Moodle/README.md

See Projects to assist with development.

## Useful commands

 * `cdk ls`          list all stacks in the app
 * `cdk synth`       emits the synthesized CloudFormation template
 * `cdk deploy`      deploy this stack to your default AWS account/region
 * `cdk diff`        compare deployed stack with current state
 * `cdk docs`        open CDK documentation

Enjoy!
